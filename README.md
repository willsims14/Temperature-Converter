#Temperature Converter
This program reads a temperature (in celsius or fahrenheit), and then the user chooses whether to convert the degrees to fahrenheit or celsius (using two radio buttons). If the temperature is low, the background-color is blue. If the temperature is high, the background-color is red. Otherwise, the background-color is green.
